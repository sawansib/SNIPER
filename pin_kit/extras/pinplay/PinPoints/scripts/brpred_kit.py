class BrPredKit(kit.Kit):
    """
    This class contains methods to run the branch predictor simulator and extract
    the metric of interest from the output files it generates.

    Users can modifying the code in the module to use a different simulator.
    The modules 'config.py' and 'replay_dir.py' must also be modified to
    reflect the new simulator.  All other code should be independent of the
    simulator.

    Alternatively, the code in this module can be used as a template to add a new simulator,
    in addition to the branch predictor simulator. To do this, all files which start with
    the string 'brpred_' must be cloned/modified for the new simulator.

    The following instructions are based on modifying the existing simulator
    (first case listed above).  If adding a new simulator, the additional modifications
    to the other 'brpred_' files, beyond the instructions given below, should be self-evident.

    I. It is assumed the simulator has at least these two options:

        1) Specify name of the file for output data
                Knob for branch predictor is '-statfile file'

        2) Print simulator data for the metric of interest every 'icount'
           instructions.  The code that runs the simulator uses this option
           with the tracing parameter 'warmup_length'.  See method GetRegionMetric()
           for more information.
                Knob for branch predictor is '-phaselen icount'

    II. Steps required in this module to add a new simulator:

        1) Modify the attributes in this class to reflect the requirements of
           the new simulator (in section "simulator control knobs").  If the only
           changes required to create a simulator kit are in this module, then the
           remaining changes are described in section III.

        2) The base class for this class is in the module 'kit.py'.  If you
           need to modify values in the base class, then there may be other
           locations in the scripts which may also need to be modified.

        3) Modify the following method to reflect the knobs in the new simulator:
                GetSimOutputFile()

        4) Modify method RunSimulator() to run the new simulator.

        5) Modify these two methods to extract the metric of interest from the
           new simulator data files:
               GetLastMetric()
               GetRegionMetric()

    III. Steps required in other modules to add a new simulator:

        1) Add a type for the new simulator in the module 'config.py' under "Types of kits".

        2) Modify the method Replay() in 'replay_dir.py'.  Search for the
           string 'options.sim_add_filename' and add code to instantiate a kit for
           the new simulator type.
